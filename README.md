# SMH SCRAPA

Having lived in Australia for so long, I still see "smh" as Sydney Morning Herald, so I chose SMH for my target and "Scrapa" for the Australian side of my life. ... Never mind that I never lived in Sydney. The Courier-Mail (Qld) is too much of a tabloid, and The Age (Vic) is too conservative.
